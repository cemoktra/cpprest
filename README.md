# cpprest
cpprest is a simple rest client using libcurl to make the calls. It makes use of `std::future` for asynchronous calls. Currently there are two incomplete API implementations in this project. 

## rest_api (not complete)
Basic classes for making rest calls. Current implementation includes what is necessary for both partial API implementations.

## tado_api (not complete)
Basic Tado smart home API calls.

## github_api (not complete)
